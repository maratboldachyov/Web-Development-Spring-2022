<p id = "desc">In this blog we would like to show you the Iceland world. You are going to Iceland and choose a tour, or maybe you are planning an independent trip, but you do not know how many days are enough for Iceland...

    This is a difficult question and there is no definite answer to it. Someone in this amazing country will not be enough for six months, and someone will get bored in 3 days. In fact, everyone will find interesting things for themselves for certainly more than three days. If you are traveling for the first time and want to get to know the country, then one of the good options is to drive along the ring road number one, such a trip both independently and as part of a tour will take from 7 to 14 days. It all depends on how intense the trip will be and how much you will be able to see on the way. 7 days is a very stressful route, while in 14 days you can relax almost everywhere on the road, including many "wild" hot springs. </p>
